3. HW3
   - Pytorch
     - Re-implementation of core components of pytorch such as loss functions (sigmoid, ReLU), train function and hyperparameter search (cross entropy, mean squared error).
     - Implementation of 5 different neural network models from scratch
   - Neural Network
     - Pytorch implementation of neural network classifier for MNIST data set

4. HW4

     - Implemntation of Llyod's algorithm from scratch
   - Principle Component Analysis (PCA)
     - Implementation of PCA on MNIST dataset
     - Digits are reconstrcuted through the dimensionality-reduced PCA basis
   - Autoencoders
     - Implementation and training of two autoencoder to perform dimensionality reduction on MNIST dataset
   - Hyperparameter Tuning
